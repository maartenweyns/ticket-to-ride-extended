This is an online version of the well-known Ticket To Ride game, made for up to 8 players!

The game is based on the desktop version of Ticket To Ride, which only supports up to 8 players. As our family is with 8 people, I got inspired to Xpand the game capabilities to 8 players!
All assets used in the game (images/sounds/...) belong to the original game developed by **[Days of Wonder](https://www.daysofwonder.com/)** and **[Asmodee Digital](https://www.asmodee-digital.com/)**.
